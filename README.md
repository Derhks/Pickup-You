## Development Environment Configuration (Ubuntu 20.04)

### Prerequisites

The following programs must be installed:
- Git version 2.25.1
- Pyenv version 2.3.4

Verify that you have `Git` and `Pyenv` installed on your computer, run the 
following commands:

```bash
git --version
```

```bash
pyenv --version
```

If you do not see the `Git` or `Pyenv` version, you must install it.

### Downloading the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Derhks/Pickup-You.git
```

Enter the project folder

```bash
cd Pickup-You/
```

### Create a virtual environment with Pyenv

Install the version of `Python` to be used by the virtual environment:

```bash
pyenv install -v 3.9.13
```

Create the `pickupyou` virtual environment

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.13 pickupyou
```

Now, let's activate the created virtual environment

```bash
pyenv activate pickupyou
```

To deactivate an active environment, use:

```bash
pyenv deactivate
```

### Install project dependencies

With the virtual environment activated we are going to install the dependencies 
used in the project

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

We must export the environment variables we need in our project. Create the 
.env file by executing the following command:

```bash
mv pickupyou/.example pickupyou/.env
```

Fill in the environment variables with their corresponding value. Finally, 
execute the following command:

```bash
export $(cat pickupyou/.env | grep -v ^# | xargs)
```

### Setup SQLite

We must create the tables that will be used by the applications in the project, 
to do so, execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

Now we create the tables of all the models that need one in the database, 
execute the command:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

### Create superuser

If you need to create a user who can log in to the administrative site, run 
the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

You must fill in the Username, Email address and Password fields to create the 
user. Start the server and enter the `/admin/` endpoint and verify that you can 
access the administrative site with the user you created.


### Run server

The application has its unit tests, run one of the following commands before 
running the server:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

Note: if running the above command fails some tests, remove the environment 
variable by executing the command 

```bash
unset URL_DRIVERS_LOCATIONS
```

And run the command again.

Let's verify that the project works, run the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

With the above command the server will operate on port 8000.

Validate from the command terminal that the server is working correctly. 
Execute the following command from another terminal:

```bash
curl -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -u `user`:`password` http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

________________________________________________________________________________
## Run development version with docker

Before proceeding, validate that you have Docker installed. Run the following 
command:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Run the following command to initialize the project using docker:

Note: The project needs environment variables that are declared in the 
`.env` file, complete all variables that do not have any value assigned, 
this is necessary for the command below to work.

```bash
docker-compose up --remove-orphans
```

At this point the application is running on port 8080 on your Docker host. Go 
to `http://localhost:8080/swagger/` in a web browser.

You can stop the containers and also delete everything that was 
created at initialization by executing the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all && sudo rm -rf data/
```

## Interactive API docs

Now go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation 
(provided by Swagger UI)
